    <h1>Privacy Policy for StepWise</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Privacy First:</strong> StepWise is built with your privacy as the top priority. We don't collect, store, or share your personal information. Your health data stays on your device.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>StepWise is designed to operate with minimal data collection:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Health Data:</strong> The app accesses your step count, walking distance, and estimated calories from Apple HealthKit. This data is read-only and remains stored exclusively in Apple Health on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Your settings (daily step goal, notification preferences, unit preferences) are stored locally on your device using iOS system storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Status:</strong> When you purchase a subscription, your payment and subscription information is processed and managed by Apple through the App Store. We only receive a subscription status confirmation from Apple.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Display Your Progress:</strong> Health data from HealthKit is used solely to display your daily steps, distance, calories, and historical trends within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Goal Tracking:</strong> Your daily step goal is used to calculate progress and send optional local notifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Features:</strong> Your subscription status determines whether ads are displayed in the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All your health data, step history, and preferences are stored locally on your device. We do not use remote servers or cloud storage.</li>
        <li><strong>No Account Required:</strong> StepWise does not require login, signup, or any personal identification.</li>
        <li><strong>HealthKit Protection:</strong> Access to your health data is protected by iOS HealthKit permissions and Apple's security infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
